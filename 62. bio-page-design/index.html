        <p> Emory Andrew Tate III is an American-British former professional kickboxer, internet personality, and social media
        influencer. In 2005, Tate started practising boxing and martial arts.
            Tate was born on December 14, 1986, in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Luton, England. His mother worked as a caterer,
            and his father, Emory Tate, was an African-descent international chess master. He is of mixed ancestry. Tate began
            playing chess at the age of five and was soon competing in adult tournaments.
            <br><br>
            In November 2008, Tate was ranked 7th best light-heavyweight kickboxer in Britain by the International Sport Kickboxing
            Association. After retiring, Tate started selling memberships and courses on the website. Since his retirement, he has
            emerged as a significant influencer despite being barred from numerous platforms for his misogynistic social media
            commentary.
            <br><br>
            Tate was detained in Romania on charges of human trafficking, rape, and forming an organized crime group in December
            2022. Authorities confirmed the charges. Both he and his brother Tristan have been under criminal investigation since
            April 2022. Their lawyer confirmed they had been detained, but they declined to comment.
            <br><br>
            Tate was permanently banned from Instagram and Facebook in August 2022 for violating their policies on hate speech,
            dangerous organizations and people. After finding out that his account broke their rules against content that attacks,
            threatens, incites violence against, or otherwise makes humans seem less than human, TikTok took away his account as
            well.
            <br><br>
            As of June 4th, 2023, Andrew and Tristian Tate, alongside the two others accused, were released from prison after a
            successful appeal and placed under house arrest by the judge. The original sentence was to run until April 29th, 2023,
            however, it was later extended for an additional 30 days before being extended again for 30 more days on May 19th, 2023.
            <br><br>
            Subsequently, YouTube also suspended his channel, saying that it had multiple violations, including hate speech and
            COVID-19 misinformation. Tate subsequently deleted his channel on Twitch. Tate said that he agreed with the bans and
            that most of his comments were taken out of context, but he takes responsibility for how they were received. Tate's
            content continued to be spread on social media even after he was banned from doing so.
